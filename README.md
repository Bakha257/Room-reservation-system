# Room-reservation-system
This project is a simple and responsive room reservation system built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view available rooms, select check-in and check-out dates, and submit reservation requests through an interactive interface â€” all without the need for external libraries or frameworks.
