# Room-reservation-system
This project is a simple and responsive room reservation system built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view available rooms, select check-in and check-out dates, and submit reservation requests through an interactive interface â€” all without the need for external libraries or frameworks.

The UI is fully responsive and user-friendly, designed with pure CSS for styling and layout. Core functionality such as date validation, form handling, and reservation logic is implemented using JavaScript.

This project demonstrates the power of clean front-end development without dependencies, ideal for learning purposes or lightweight applications.
